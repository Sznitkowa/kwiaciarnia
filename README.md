Dear User! 👋🏻

This repo contains the code of my private, non-commercial project: https://sznitkowa.github.io/kwiaciarnia/ 💻
The website aims to present the offer of a flower shop and encourage customers to use the services of this company.
I created the website mockup from scratch in figma, came up with the company name and the whole concept.
I wanted the site to be user friendly and easy to use and to encourage to contact with owner of the flower shop and to expand his customer base through the site 🌷

Have a nice day! 🌞
